                        <b>Trigger</b> An ally is about to use an action that
                        requires a skill check or attack roll.
                        <br />
                        <b>Requirements</b> The ally is willing to accept your
                        aid, and you have prepared to help (see below).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You try to help your ally with a task. To use this
                        reaction, you must first prepare to help, usually by
                        using an action during your turn. You must explain to
                        the GM exactly how you're trying to help, and they
                        determine whether you can Aid your ally.
                        <br />
                        When you use your Aid reaction, attempt a skill check or
                        attack roll of a type decided by the GM. The typical DC
                        is 20, but the GM might adjust this DC for particularly
                        hard or easy tasks. The GM can add any relevant traits
                        to your preparatory action or to your Aid reaction
                        depending on the situation, or even allow you to Aid
                        checks other than skill checks and attack rolls.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Critical Success</b> You grant your ally a +2
                        circumstance bonus to the triggering check. If you're a
                        master with the check you attempted, the bonus is +3,
                        and if you're legendary, it's +4.
                        <br />
                        <b>Success</b> You grant your ally a +1 circumstance
                        bonus to the triggering check.
                        <br />
                        <b>Critical</b> Failure Your ally takes a -1
                        circumstance penalty to the triggering check.

                        manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged
                        attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's
                        using.

                    <p>
                        You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening. Make a
                        melee Strike against the triggering creature. If your
                        attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a
                        manipulate action, you disrupt that action. This Strike
                        doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and
                        your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this
                        Strike.

                        turn occur immediately when you use the Delay action.
                        Any beneficial effects that would end at any point
                        during your turn also end. The GM might determine that
                        other effects end when you Delay as well. Essentially,
                        you can't Delay to avoid negative consequences that
                        would happen on your turn or to extend beneficial
                        effects that would end on your turn.

                        <b>Success</b> You can tell whether the creature is
                        behaving normally, but you don't know its exact
                        intentions or what magic might be affecting it.
                        <br />
                        <b>Failure</b> You detect what a deceptive creature
                        wants you to believe. If they're not being deceptive,
                        you believe they're behaving normally.

                        <b>Success</b> If you have at least one hand free, you
                        grab the edge or handhold, stopping your fall. You still
                        take damage from the distance fallen so far, but you
                        treat the fall as though it were 20 feet shorter. If you
                        have no hands free, you continue to fall as if you had
                        failed the check.
                        <br />
                        <b>Critical Failure</b> You continue to fall, and if
                        you've fallen 20 feet or more before you use this
                        reaction, you take 10 bludgeoning damage from the impact
                        for every 20 feet fallen.

                        You repeatedly cast the same spell while moving at half

                        per minute to ensure you check everything before you
                        walk into it. You can always move more slowly while

                        In locations with many objects to search, you have to
                        stop and spend significantly longer to search

                        the nature of the place where you're trying to Subsist.
                        You might need a minimum proficiency rank to Subsist in
                        particularly strange environments. Unlike most downtime

                        subsistence living.

                        something you shouldn't, or otherwise worsen your

                        takes 10 minutes and requires a disguise kit (found on
                        page 290), but a simpler, quicker disguise might do the
                        job if you're not trying to imitate a specific
                        individual.

                        Creatures have a chance to detect your deception only if
                        they use the Seek action to attempt Perception checks
                        against your Deception DC. If you attempt to directly
                        interact with someone while disguised, the GM rolls a
                        secret Deception check for you against that creature's
                        Perception DC instead. If you're disguised as a specific
                        individual, the GM might give creatures you interact
                        with a circumstance bonus based on how well they know
                        the person you're imitating, or the GM might roll a
                        secret Deception check even if you aren't directly

                        attempt a new check if your behavior changes.

                        at least 1 round, or longer if the lie is elaborate. You
                        roll a single Deception check and compare it against the
                        Perception DC of every creature you are trying to fool.
                        The GM might give them a circumstance bonus based on the

                        harder to get a creature to believe than simpler and
                        more believable lies, and some lies are so big that it's
                        impossible to get anyone to believe them.

                        modified by any circumstances the GM determines. The
                        attitudes referenced in the effects below are summarized
                        in the Changing Attitudes sidebar on page 246 and
                        described in full in the Conditions Appendix, starting

                        <b>Critical Success</b> The target gives you the
                        information you seek or agrees to follow your directives
                        so long as they aren't likely to harm the target in any
                        way. The target continues to comply for an amount of
                        time determined by the GM but not exceeding 1 day, at
                        which point the target becomes unfriendly (if they
                        weren't already unfriendly or hostile). However, the
                        target is too scared of you to retaliate—at least in the
                        short term.
                        <br />
                        <b>Success</b> As critical success, but once the target
                        becomes unfriendly, they might decide to act against
                        you.
                        <br />
                        <b>Failure</b> The target doesn't do what you say, if
                        they were not already unfriendly or hostile, they become
                        unfriendly.
                        <br />
                        <b>Critical Failure</b> The target refuses to comply,
                        becomes hostile if they weren't already, and can't be
                        Coerced by you for at least 1 week.

                        You issue an order to an animal. Attempt a Nature check
                        against the its Will DC. The GM might adjust the DC if
                        the animal has a good attitude toward you, you suggest a
                        course of action it was predisposed toward, or you offer
                        it a treat.

                    <p>
                        You automatically fail if the animal is hostile or
                        unfriendly to you. If the animal is helpful to you,
                        increase your degree of success by one step. You might
                        be able to Command an Animal more easily with a feat
                        like Ride (page 266).

                        Most animals know the Drop Prone, Leap, Seek, Stand,
                        Game Stride, and Strike basic actions. If an animal
                        knows an activity, such as a horse's Gallop, you can
                        Command the Animal to perform the activity, but you must
                        spend as many actions on Command an Animal as the
                        activity's number of actions. You can also spend
                        multiple actions to Command the Animal to perform that
                        number of basic actions on its next turn; for instance,
                        you could spend 3 actions to Command an Animal to Stride
                        three times or to Stride twice and then Strike.

                        on its own, but it might influence the DCs of subsequent

                        Over the course of a day or week, you create a forged
                        document. You must have the proper writing material to
                        create a forgery. When you Create a Forgery, the GM
                        rolls a secret DC 20 Society check. Only those who
                        examine the document and attempt a Perception or Society
                        check against your Society DC can detect a successful
                        forgery.

                        If the document's handwriting doesn't need to be
                        specific to a person, you need only to have seen a
                        similar document before, and you gain up to a +4
                        circumstance bonus to your check, as well as to your DC.
                        To forge a specific person's handwriting, you need a
                        sample of that person's handwriting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For results below 20, the forgery has some obvious signs
                        of being a fake, so the GM compares your result to each
                        passive observer's Perception DC or Society DC,
                        whichever is higher, using the success or failure
                        results below. Once the GM rolls your check for a
                        document, that same result is used against all passive
                        observers' DCs no matter how many creatures passively
                        observe that document.

                        attack, and you then become observed. If you do anything
                        else, you become observed just before you act.

                        stay oriented in the wild. Typically, you attempt a

                        or changes might necessitate rolling more often. The GM
                        determines the DC and how long this activity takes
                        (usually just a minute or so). More unusual locales or
                        those you're unfamiliar with might require you to have a

                        Attempt a Thievery check to determine if you

                        usually the Perception DC of the creature wearing the

                        or an object within such a pouch). If the object is in a

                        <b>Requirements</b> You are trained in Stealth and youre
                        holding or wearing thieves tools (page 291).
                    </p>

                        Opening a lock without a key is very similar to
                        Disabling a Device, but the DC of the check is
                        determined by the complexity and construction of the
                        lock you are attempting to pick (locks and their DCs are
                        found on page 290). Locks of higher qualities might
                        require multiple successes to unlock, since otherwise
                        even an unskilled burglar could easily crack the lock by
                        attempting the check until they rolled a natural 20. If
                        you lack the proper tools, the GM might let you used
                        improvised picks, which are treated as shoddy tools,
                        depending on the specifics of the lock.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Critical Success</b> You unlock the lock, or you
                        achieve two successes toward opening a complex lock. You
                        leave no trace of your tampering.
                        <br />
                        <b>Success</b> You open the lock, or you achieve one
                        success toward opening a complex lock.
                        <br />
                        <b>Critical Failure</b> You break your tools. Fixing
                        them requires using Crafting to Repair them or else
                        swapping in replacement picks (costing 3 sp, or 3 gp for
                        infiltrator thieves tools).
