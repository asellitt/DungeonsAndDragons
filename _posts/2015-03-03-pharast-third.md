The start of spring is meant to be full of happiness with an abundance of new life coming into this world, however even this little piece of joy has been scraped away from me over the past few years. It’s been 14 years since I left Easthallow and I’m no closer to finding anything that will help the situation at home. What I’ve learnt in this time is that this world is a big and dangerous place where everyone has their own problems. It wasn’t long after leaving home that I came across a source of natural corruption and I’ve followed it west but I seem to have lost it’s trail for now. This isn’t like the stories i was told growing up at home, I was always excited at the prospect of being able to explore the world but now even the prospect of staying in the forest forever sounds appealing, or it would if it wasn’t for the darkness taking hold of my homeland. For now I’m camped in the woods outside the town of Sandpoint taking shelter from a storm that has swept through over the last few days. Hopefully it just blows over and I can pick up the trail.
