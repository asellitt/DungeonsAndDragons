Clearly intrigued by the Elf, Venalis decided to join the company on their way to discover the whereabouts of the creature. Pring was clearly unhappy about this, and Venalis' insistence on conversing in Elven to Zaradae only served to increase Prings level of frustration.

"COMMON! SPEAK IN COMMON!" he roared, loud enough to shock several birds off of their perches and send them soaring into the sky.

Venalis drew his blade and in clear, unaccented, Common warned Pring, "You will watch your tongue, or I will remove it from your face, Orc."

Zaradae smoothly stepped in between the two, knowing full well the magnitude of the explosion that is Prings temper. She was a little worried about Venalis physical well being.

Before Zaradae could say anything, Moonfeather jumped in. "Enough. Both of you. Pring has a point, you have chosen to join us and there can be no secrets between us if we are to find this creature. It is also nearly time to make camp. We should decide who takes watch."

Moonfeather was right, of course, the sun had long since begun its downward journey, and twilight had descended over the road. The companions made camp, Zaradae offered to take the first watch, and Venalis offered to take the second. Pring slept lightly that night and roused himself when Zaradae shook Venalis awake for his watch. Clearly distrustful of the Elf, Pring decided a half nights rest would be preferrable to the risk that Venalis may betray them, and entered into a light meditative state.

Venalis awoke the party just prior to dawn. Reaching out to wake Pring, his eyes widened in surprise as he realised that Pring was watching him. The rest of the party came awake and they continued their journey. Little before mid morning the company spied their destination. The entrance looked more like a cave than that of an underground fortress. A thick curtain of green moss hung over the doorway, obscuring whatever lay beyond. Standing in front of the entrance was an old, menacing stone statue of a warrior. Upon closer inspection, Pring and Venalis realised that the warrior statue was well over a hundred years old. It was impossible to tell what race the warrior represented as its features were damaged beyond recognition by what appeared to be acid scars.

Distracted by the statue, the companions were caught unawares as the thick, green moss curtain parted and a pair of clearly drunk Goblins stumbled out. Still clutching their flagons, and bearing large toothy grins, they charged at the party. They had imbibed far more alcohol than they realised and were barely able to rush without tripping over themselves. With the element of surprise lost, the ugly creatures did not stand a chance.

After quickly dispatching with the two drunkards, Venalis pulled back the curtain to reveal a dark cavernous room with two bare straw filled pallets and a half rotten old chest.

"Stand back, I've got this!" And without any other form of warning, Pring stepped up to the decrepid box and began to pummel it into splinters. Although it took him a bit longer than expected, he was rather pleased with himself when the chest finally broke apart and revealed its treasures; a masterwork dagger, a small ruby, and a vial of unidentified orange liquid.

Waiting patiently for Pring to finish, Venalis lifted up one of the straw pallets and revealed an ornate and rusted key. Moonfeather, Zaradae and Venalis shared a hearty laugh at the Half-Orcs expense. Clearly embarrassed, Pring stormed passed the others and barrelled through the stone doors leading throught to the next room. He barely managed to weave his way through before the doors came swinging back.

"He's been gone for an awful long time. Should we see where he's gotten to?" Zaradae was starting to feel a little worried.

The others followed Pring, carefully pushing open the door, and found him staring in awe at the golden radiance that reflected like sunlight bouncing off of a calm ocean. The light emanated off of the rune covered surface of the large fountain that dominated the centre of the room. In the quiet faint talking noises could be heard, but the source was not able to be located. Moonfeather stepped over to the fountain and attempted to decipher the runes. She was unable to uncover their meaning but did notice that there were quite a number of gold coins at the bottom of the fountain. Trusting to her luck, she flicked a coin into the fountain and cupped a handful of water to her mouth. A few seconds after parting with the rest of the body of water, the glow of water in Moonfeathers hand began to fade. She then drank it.

"See? Nothing to worry about. The fool is here. Moonfeather, how do you feel?" Venalis enquired in Elven.

This snapped Pring out of his trance like state immediately. "COMMONNNN!" He roared.

He once again stormed out on the rest of the party, back through the doors that they had just passed through. Following quickly, Zaradae and Moonfeather stepped through just in time to see him slump down onto one of the straw pallets and drop into a meditative state. Venalis followed shortly after shaking his head.

"Old habits. He is a touchy one, isnt he?" The glare from Zaradae silenced him.

The party tried many things to rouse him from his meditation, even the promise of ale, but all failed. Resigning themselves to the possibility of facing the creature with one fewer member, they decided to continue on. Seeing no ill effects from the fountain on Moonfeather, both Zaradae and Venalis flicked a coin in and drank a mouthful of the enchanted waters. With two exits from this chamber, a tunnel leading north and stone doors concealing a path to the east, the companions decided to head east. ##Actually,we went north##

Feeling nervous about Prings outburst and wanting to ensure a quick escape, the companions used the rusted swords that they looted off of the bodies of the Goblins that attacked them in the forest to hold open the stone doors. The doors swung open silently to reveal a chamber bathed in red light. On the far east side of the room a pair of stone statues stood like sentinels on either side of a large, rune inscribed, stone altar. Atop the altar sat a thick layer of dust, not thick enough, however, to obscure the dim, creepy red light spewing forth from the large gemstone sitting on it.

Venalis, suspecting a trap, cast a minor enchantment to reveal magical signatures. He discovered that both the stone statues and the red gemstone were, indeed, magically enchanted. Warning his companions, he took a tentative step forward.

"Approach with humility and live!" boomed a loud voice from the stone statues.

Pring heard the booming rumble and gracefully arose from his meditation. Having cleared his mind, he felt ready to grant the arrogant Venalis a second chance. Stealthily, Pring followed in his companions footsteps, stopping along the way to drink from the fountain. He did not offer a gold coin.
