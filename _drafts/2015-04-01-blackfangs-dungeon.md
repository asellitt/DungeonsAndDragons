Clearly intrigued by the Elf, Venalis decided to join the company on their way to discover the whereabouts of the creature. Pring was clearly unhappy about this, and Venalis' insistence on conversing in Elven to Zaradae only served to increase Prings level of frustration.

"COMMON! SPEAK IN COMMON!" he roared, loud enough to shock several birds off of their perches and send them soaring into the sky.

Venalis drew his blade and in clear, unaccented, Common warned Pring, "You will watch your tongue, or I will remove it from your face, Orc."

Zaradae smoothly stepped in between the two, knowing full well the magnitude of the explosion that is Prings temper. She was a little worried about Venalis physical well being.

Before Zaradae could say anything, Moonfeather jumped in. "Enough. Both of you. Pring has a point, you have chosen to join us and there can be no secrets between us if we are to find this creature. It is also nearly time to make camp. We should decide who takes watch."

Moonfeather was right, of course, the sun had long since begun its downward journey, and twilight had descended over the road. The companions made camp, Zaradae offered to take the first watch, and Venalis offered to take the second. Pring slept lightly that night and roused himself when Zaradae shook Venalis awake for his watch. Clearly distrustful of the Elf, Pring decided a half nights rest would be preferrable to the risk that Venalis may betray them, and entered into a light meditative state.

Venalis awoke the party just prior to dawn. Reaching out to wake Pring, his eyes widened in surprise as he realised that Pring was watching him. The rest of the party came awake and they continued their journey. Little before mid morning the company spied their destination. The entrance looked more like a cave than that of an underground fortress. A thick curtain of green moss hung over the doorway, obscuring whatever lay beyond. Standing in front of the entrance was an old, menacing stone statue of a warrior. Upon closer inspection, Pring and Venalis realised that the warrior statue was well over a hundred years old. It was impossible to tell what race the warrior represented as its features were damaged beyond recognition by what appeared to be acid scars.

Distracted by the statue, the companions were caught unawares as the thick, green moss curtain parted and a pair of clearly drunk Goblins stumbled out. Still clutching their flagons, and bearing large toothy grins, they charged at the party. They had imbibed far more alcohol than they realised and were barely able to rush without tripping over themselves. With the element of surprise lost, the ugly creatures did not stand a chance.

After quickly dispatching with the two drunkards, Venalis pulled back the curtain to reveal a dark cavernous room with two bare straw filled pallets and a half rotten old chest.

"Stand back, I've got this!" And without any other form of warning, Pring stepped up to the decrepid box and began to pummel it into splinters. Although it took him a bit longer than expected, he was rather pleased with himself when the chest finally broke apart and revealed its treasures; a masterwork dagger, a small ruby, and a vial of unidentified orange liquid.

Waiting patiently for Pring to finish, Venalis lifted up one of the straw pallets and revealed an ornate and rusted key. Moonfeather, Zaradae and Venalis shared a hearty laugh at the Half-Orcs expense. Clearly embarrassed, Pring stormed passed the others and barrelled through the stone doors leading throught to the next room. He barely managed to weave his way through before the doors came swinging back.

"He's been gone for an awful long time. Should we see where he's gotten to?" Zaradae was starting to feel a little worried.

The others followed Pring, carefully pushing open the door, and found him staring in awe at the golden radiance that reflected like sunlight bouncing off of a calm ocean. The light emanated off of the rune covered surface of the large fountain that dominated the centre of the room. In the quiet faint talking noises could be heard, but the source was not able to be located. Moonfeather stepped over to the fountain and attempted to decipher the runes. She was unable to uncover their meaning but did notice that there were quite a number of gold coins at the bottom of the fountain. Trusting to her luck, she flicked a coin into the fountain and cupped a handful of water to her mouth. A few seconds after parting with the rest of the body of water, the glow of water in Moonfeathers hand began to fade. She then drank it.

"See? Nothing to worry about. The fool is here. Moonfeather, how do you feel?" Venalis enquired in Elven.

This snapped Pring out of his trance like state immediately. "COMMONNNN!" He roared.

He once again stormed out on the rest of the party, back through the doors that they had just passed through. Following quickly, Zaradae and Moonfeather stepped through just in time to see him slump down onto one of the straw pallets and drop into a meditative state. Venalis followed shortly after shaking his head.

"Old habits. He is a touchy one, isnt he?" The glare from Zaradae silenced him.

The party tried many things to rouse him from his meditation, even the promise of ale, but all failed. Resigning themselves to the possibility of facing the creature with one fewer member, they decided to continue on. Seeing no ill effects from the fountain on Moonfeather, both Zaradae and Venalis flicked a coin in and drank a mouthful of the enchanted waters. With two exits from this chamber, a tunnel leading north and stone doors concealing a path to the east, and no real strategy in mind, Zaradae stepped closer to the northern tunnel. The faint voices grew louder.

"I hear something up ahead, step lightly"

Faint torchlight comming from up ahead revealed several crude drawings of Goblins on the tunnel walls. Following the short tunnel around, the adventurers found that the drawings covered the walls of the chamber. A handful of Goblins stood around another Goblin sitting in what appeared to be a throne made from animal bones. The surrounding Goblins were in a heated arguement, shoving and shouting in their language at each other and at the seated Goblin. It took them a moment to notice that intruders had entered their domain and they immediately stopped arguing and stared menacingly at the party. The throned Goblin, relieved that the shouting had stopped, pulled is fingers from his ears and opened his eyes, and was visibily startled to see the newcomers.

Clearly an attempt to impress his followers, the throned Goblin straightened in his seat and in broken Common grunted, "Who you? This throne room of me, King Fatmouth!"

Moonfeather took stock of the situation, the Goblins didn't appear to be getting ready for a fight, and took a chance. "Ah hello! We're adventurers looking for a large creature. Can you&mdash;"

The King Fatmouth harrumphed and waved at his followers. They began to draw their weapons.

"Ah, if you would... Your impressive excellency!" Moonfeather performed a deep bow, "Please&mdash;"

"Impressive? Yes! Impressive! King Fatmouth most impressive!" Moonfeather cleverly managed to inflate the Kings sense of self worth. He waved down his followers, who resheathed their weapons. "You want help? Me want help first. Me sister, Bucktooth, stole dragon toy. Her missing now. These idiots too scared to find toy. You find toy! I let you live and you can visit many times!"

"A most agreeable trade, my King"

"Dragon toy have wing and mouth that move. Bucktooth took to cave with big spider webs. That way" The Goblin pointed back the way they had come from.

Feeling a wave of serenity wash over him, Pring gracefully arose from his meditation. Having cleared his mind, he felt ready to grant the arrogant Venalis a second chance. Stealthily, Pring followed in his companions footsteps, stopping along the way to drink from the fountain. He did not offer a gold coin.

The companions backtracked towards the fountain room and found Pring staring at the stone door leading to the eastward room. No words were exchanged and Pring pushed open the doors. The doors swung open silently to reveal a chamber bathed in red light. On the far east side of the room a pair of stone statues stood like sentinels on either side of a large, rune inscribed, stone altar. Atop the altar sat a thick layer of dust, not thick enough, however, to obscure the dim, creepy red light spewing forth from the large gemstone sitting on it.

Feeling nervous about Prings outburst and wanting to ensure a quick escape, Moonfeather suggested that they use the rusted sword that they looted off of the Goblins that attacked them in the forest to hold open the stone doors. Venalis, suspecting a trap, cast a minor enchantment to reveal magical signatures. He discovered that both the stone statues and the red gemstone were, indeed, magically enchanted. Warning his companions, he took a tentative step forward.

"Approach with humility and live!" a deep, loud voice boomed from the stone statues. As the others entered the room, the statues intonned the same warning.

"Perhaps we should pay our respects to the altar?" Moonfeather suggested.

Deciding to test Moonfeathers suggestion out, Pring approached the altar carefully. Taking small cautious steps, he found himself at the foot of the dias. Throwing caution to the wind, bowed his head he knelt down on the dias. As his knee made contact with the floor the entire room errupted into flames. Two geysers of fire spurted out of the stone statues, passing over Prings head and stopping just short of the rest of the party. Stunned beyond words, Pring remained frozen and before long the fire stopped. A short time after that, it errupted again.

Venalis paid careful attention to the timing, realising that the flames spurted out for precicely fifteen seconds, and remained dormant for exactly five seconds afterwards. Picking his way carefully around the edge of the room, careful not to step into any of the areas he had mentally marked as dangerous, he nimbly lept up on the dias and snatched the ruby from the altar. Breathing rapidly, he lay prone on the floor next to Pring and waited for the flames to subside.

Once the pair were safely away from the threat of the flames Venalis took a moment to study the ruby. Remembering that there was something more to this gem, he took a moment to perform his divinaion once more.

"Oh, my! This is an energy heart. If I'm reading this aura correctly it should be able to save its owner from a portion of elemental damage. Uhm, fire, acid, cold and possibly electric." Venalis pocketed the gem. "Shall we continue?"

Not quite over their paranoia, this time the group used the notched sword to keep the southward door open. Stepping through into the short corridor the company quickly found themselves covered in whispy strands of spider webs.

"I think this may have been where Fatmouth's sister ran off to." Moonfeather observed, "Perhaps Archemedes can have a wander around and see what he can see."

Just before Moonfeather sent the owl on its way, Venalis placed a hand on his lips and motioned for quiet. In an extremely lucky happenstance he spied the tiniest of movements amongst the thicker webbing further into the room. Pointing this out to his companions, they barely managed to make out the outline of the giant spider lying in wait for the unfortunate souls to step into its domain.

With the element of surprise on their side both Venalis and Zaradae unslung their long bows and prepared to fire. Almost simultaneously Moonfeather readied a burst of arcane energy. The three projectiles slammed into the creature, severely wounding it but not quite finishing it off outright. Pring, not one to wait, bounded out infront of the others and pounced onto the spider. In a combination of pain and surprise the spider reared back and attempted to sink its fangs into Prings unarmoured chest. Far more nimble than a creature his size should rightly be, Pring leaped frogged over the spider, landing behind it and pivoted to begin pummeling its abdomen. Deciding that the Half-Orc was the more immediate threat, the spider spun around and once again attempted to deliver a venomous bite. Before it could finish the maneuver, two more arrows embedded into its body and Pring watched as the light slowly faded from its many eyes.

The companions allowed themselves a quick moment of congratulations before exploring the chamber more thoroughly. They quickly discovered the dessicated remains of a small Goblinoid creature and at its feet, tangled amongst the webs, discovered a small poorly crafted wooden box. Inside they found a handful of coins, a wand with a few remaining charges of magic missiles and an extremely well crafted dragon figurine.

"Ah excellent, this should allow us to pass the Goblins without any trouble." Moonfeather was quite pleased about the deal she had secured.

"Pah, Half-Elf! They're just Goblins. Are you afraid of them?" Pring chided.

The look Moonfeather shot at Pring silenced his laughs immediately.

The Goblins shriek of delight echoed off of the cave walls when Moonfeather handed over the toy dragon. He motioned the rest of the group closer.

"You bring back! You bring back! Sister dead? Good! Now she no steal toy again! You have this too." He pointed to a chest sitting behind his throne. "Also, we share this!" He pulled out two large bottles of Valeros Pale Ale.

Prings eyes immediately lit up. "Moonfeather! Maybe this wasn't such a bad idea!" Pring crooned as he sauntered over towards the King. Inside the chest they discovered a large pile of coins, a handful of pearls, a wand with several charges of cure light wounds and a magically enchanted ring of protection.

After Fatmouth finished his ale, he warned the companions about the creature. "If you here to fight dragon, aim for belly. Got soft belly scales." He just managed to finish his sentence before blasting out a loud belch. Rising to the challenge, Pring followed suit with an even more impressive burp. "North. Go that way for dragon lair."

"Dragon..?" A wave of unease passed through the adventurers. "At least now we know what it is." Zaradae found herself having second thoughts.

"Yes, well before we charge in, lets have a more thorough look around here." Venalis gestured to a different tunnel that also lead to the east.

They rounded a bend in the tunnel and found themselves in a cavern almost as large as the ones the Goblins called home. Up ahead they found a subterranean pond which nearly complely filled the chamber. On the far side of the body of water they spied a small island where some unidentifiable thing glittered in the torchlight.

"Tie a rope around me, I'll swim across." Pring suggested. "If it looks like I might be in trouble, pull me back. Fast."

Securely tied to one end of the rope, pring jumped into the pool and began kicking his powerful legs to reach the other side. He thought he saw a dark shape swim under him, but when nothing happened, he felt sure that it was just a trick of the light. He reached the far shore with no problems and began to wipe the water from his face. As he turned toward his companions to signal the success, a dark shape shot out of the water and landed on the shore. Its dark elongated body was covered in long red spikes and it held its two massive claws menacingly in front of it. Making clicking aounds with its pincers, it charged at Pring.
