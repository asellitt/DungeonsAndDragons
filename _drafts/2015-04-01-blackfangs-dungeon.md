Clearly intrigued by the Elf, Venalis decided to join the company on their way to discover the whereabouts of the creature. Pring was clearly unhappy about this, and Venalis' insistence on conversing in Elven to Zaradae only served to increase Prings level of frustration.

"COMMON! SPEAK IN COMMON!" he roared, loud enough to shock several birds off of their perches and send them soaring into the sky.

Venalis drew his blade and in clear, unaccented, Common warned Pring, "You will watch your tongue, or I will remove it from your face, Orc."

Zaradae smoothly stepped in between the two, knowing full well the magnitude of the explosion that is Prings temper. She was a little worried about Venalis physical well being.

Before Zaradae could say anything, Moonfeather jumped in. "Enough. Both of you. Pring has a point, you have chosen to join us and there can be no secrets between us if we are to find this creature. It is also nearly time to make camp. We should decide who takes watch."

Moonfeather was right, of course, the sun had long since begun its downward journey, and twilight had descended over the road. The companions made camp, Zaradae offered to take the first watch, and Venalis offered to take the second. Pring slept lightly that night and roused himself when Zaradae shook Venalis awake for his watch. Clearly distrustful of the Elf, Pring decided a half nights rest would be preferrable to the risk that Venalis may betray them, and entered into a light meditative state.

Venalis awoke the party just prior to dawn. Reaching out to wake Pring, his eyes widened in surprise as he realised that Pring was watching him. The rest of the party came awake and they continued their journey. Little before mid morning the company spied their destination. The entrance looked more like a cave than that of an underground fortress. A thick curtain of green moss hung over the doorway, obscuring whatever lay beyond. Standing in front of the entrance was an old, menacing stone statue of a warrior. Upon closer inspection, Pring and Venalis realised that the warrior statue was well over a hundred years old. It was impossible to tell what race the warrior represented as its features were damaged beyond recognition by what appeared to be acid scars.

Distracted by the statue, the companions were caught unawares as the thick, green moss curtain parted and a pair of clearly drunk Goblins stumbled out. Still clutching their flagons, and bearing large toothy grins, they charged at the party. They had imbibed far more alcohol than they realised and were barely able to rush without tripping over themselves. With the element of surprise lost, the ugly creatures did not stand a chance.

After quickly dispatching with the two drunkards, Venalis pulled back the curtain to reveal a dark cavernous room with two bare straw filled pallets and a half rotten old chest.

"Stand back, I've got this!" Without any other form of warning, Pring stepped up to the decrepid box and began to pummel it into splinters. Although it took him a bit longer than expected, he was rather pleased with himself when the chest finally broke apart and revealed its treasures.

Waiting patiently for Pring to finish, Venalis lifted up one of the straw pallets and revealed an ornate and rusted key. Moonfeather, Zaradae and Venalis shared a hearty laugh at the Half-Orcs expense. Grumbling to himself, Pring proceeded past them into the next room.
