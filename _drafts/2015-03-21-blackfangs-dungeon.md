Kendra, the mayor of the coastal township of Sandpoint, rubbed the bridge of her nose once more.

"Look, it's quite a simple task. Find out where the creature nests and destroy it. I've got a pile of petitions from scared farmers reporting loss of livestock. I can't understand why no one has been able to find this thing with all the damage it has been causing." Kendra said as she glanced over at the stack of parchments sitting precariously on the corner of her ornate blackwood desk.

Moonfeather turned the blackened claw over in her hand and studied it for a moment before she asked, "And, how many adventurers have attempted to find the creature? Is there anyone in town that I may be able ask to find out more about the creature?"

"Unfortunately there is no one else to ask." Kendra sighed in exasperation, "No one has offered their assistance, even when we increased the reward. You are the first. Can you help us?"

The nod from Moonfeather was more than enough to send Kendra into an excited flurry of activity. She stepped over to the wall behind her desk and motioned for Moonfeather to join her. A large map of Sandpoint and its surrounding lands adorned the wall. Kendra pointed out a series of pins that denoted some of the surrouding farmland.

"All of the reports I've read thus far are from here. My advisers assure me that the creature should be within this area." Kendra waved her arm about in an approximation of a circle. "There is an abandoned cave system here, and I have been told that the creature is likely there."

An owl shaped tattoo on Moonfeather's upper arm began to glow with a pale white light. The light floated away from her arm and coalesced into a snowy coloured owl. Kendra's eyes widened in shock and she took a few steps back as the owl perched upon Moonfeather's shoulder.

"Don't be alarmed, Mayor. This is Archemedes." Moonfeather felt a wave of apprehension emanate from Archemedes and flow through her. "Abandoned caves, right. I think I may require some help. May I hang on to this claw?"

"What ever you need."

The salty smell of the coastal air was the first thing that Moonfeather noticed as she left the Town Hall. Hailing from the Storval Plateau in central Varisia, Moonfeather had very little to do with coastal towns and oceans. A soft hoot from Archemedes brought Moonfeather out of her little reverie and brought the immediacy of her problem to the front of her mind. She felt sure that this creature was beyond her capabilities and that she would need to recruit some other like minded adventurers to help her out. The reluctance of the locals to take this problem on, especially when the substantial reward was considered, left her feeling that this task was going to be quite difficult.

Moonfeather spent the remainder of the day strolling about Sandpoint and enjoying its various sights. Before she knew it, the sky had darkened and a loud rumbling signalled that this was not a night to be caught out side. Following a few locals down Market Street, Moonfeather stopped short of crossing South Bridge, and found herself staring at a large wooden building with an oversized and rusted dragon statue looming out from over the roof. The Rusty Dragon was a reputable inn, and so Moonfeather decided to enquire about some food and lodging.

The inn's main hall was well lit, with chandeliers full of magically enchanted smokeless candles that never burn down. Moonfeathers eyes were immediately drawn to the long timber bar, where she watched the dancing candle lights reflect of its highly polished surface.

"Oi! Bar wench! Ale, please!" Moonfeather looked around the hall to find one of the patrons, a large half orc, staring right at her. "Actually, better make it two!"

"I'm not-", began Moonfeather.

"Pring, you halfwit, she's clearly not a bar wench." said the half orcs elven companion.

Moonfeather decided to act on this opportunity and headed over to the bar. She then strolled over to Pring and his companion, bearing two flagons of ale.

"Here you are," she said as she sat down. "My name is Moonfeather, and I'm looking for some help with a local matter."

Before Moonfeather had even finished her sentence, Pring had quaffed the first ale in what appeared to be a single gulp, and had managed to get half way throught the second one. The elf watched him with a look of disgust on her face.

"Forgive my brutish friend. I'm Zaradae. What did you need?" the elf asked.

Pring cut in and began talking over Zaradae; "Err, will there be more ale? If we help you, I mean?"

"Yes, err, Pring, was it? There will be lots more ale if we manage to complete our task." Moonfeather recounted the details of the job to the unlikely pair, showing them the blackened claw. Pleased with the prospect of more ale, Pring acquiesced. It was clear to Moonfeather that Zaradae had reservations about the job, but was not going to let Pring go along without her.
