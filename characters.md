![Moonfeather](/assets/images/characters/moonfeather.png)

Moonfeather was born to a noble mother in a important elven community. At the
age of 6 Moonfeather was saved during a raid on the village and ended up living
with a barbiran tribe at the North of the country. As she grew Moonfeathers
arcane powers began developing. With the help of the barbian tribe she
controlled her unpredicatble magic in magical tatoos which now adorn her skin.

Little is known of her father, however there is something otherworldly in her
past, where else could this strong unpredictable magic force come from?

When she was old enough Moonfeather was able to leave the barbian tribe and went
in search for her mother. When she returned to the village she returned to find
it long in ruin. Since then Moonfeather has been searching for her missing
history. Her noble birth has given her the skills she needs to work with others
and also to get other people to help her with tasks.

With the help of her familiar, Archemides, she searches and helps those who are
less fortunate then her.

![Pring](/assets/images/characters/pring.png)

The Khurshid people have always been a nomadic tribe of outcasts. The Tzhao
family were shunned and banished from their village of Dumitru when the royal
family discovered the forbidden relationship between Prince Gulbrand and his Orc
slave caretaker Amara Tzhao. After wandering the wilderness for days without
food and drink Amara stumbled into a clearing where the Khurshid people were
camping. Her intrusion was met with aggression and hostility and before she
could open her mouth to speak she was immediately slain.

The leader of the Kurshid people, Marius, found the almost lifeless body of
Pring cradled in the arms of the slain Orc female. He decided to take him in as
an adopted son. Marius trains Pring in the monk arts to try and curb the violent
nature of his Orc heritage. Years pass and the time comes for Pring to leave the
Khurshid people to complete his training. He promptly leaves the Khurshid people
behind to commence his own journey with the goal of to discovering his past and
obtaining enlightenment.

After travelling for several days Pring decided to make camp. Hidden within his
pack he finds a sealed envelope detailing the events of his mother’s senseless
murder. Upon discovering this Pring immediately starts running back the way he
came from in a furious rage. This however was short lived as the rage was
extinguished when he noticed several arrows sticking out of his shoulder
courtesy of the elf ranger Zaradae, who had been following the brute. She
reasons with him, by getting him fairly intoxicated on ale, and he decides that
he needs to be stronger if he wants any chance for vengeance.

Determined to eventually avenge the loss of his mother and find his heritage,
Pring decided to follow Zaradae in the hope her elven abilities will help him
eventually extract his revenge.

#Venalis Shadowsong, Elf Druid

![Venalis](/assets/images/characters/venalis.png)

Venalis was born into a family of well respected elves in the city of Easthallow
situated deep in the Shadowsong forest. His early years were spent learning
about the forest and how important balance was for their survival. His father
Etrian, taught Venalis how to master the bow and be self sufficient by hunting
and tracking. Nexxis, his mother taught Venalis about the druidic culture and at
an early age he had signs of great magical potential. Unfortunately, near
Venalis's 80th year, Etrian fell ill, and even with the best efforts of both
Nexxis and Venalis they were unable to heal Etrian. It took his father's life
for Venalis to dedicate his life towards the druidic arts, vowing that he would
never lose something dear to him again. Venalis would become a powerful druid
within the town of Easthallow, however unlike most druids he always carried a
bow, not wanting to part with his father's legacy.

The day that Venalis become of age he embarked on one of the elves coming of age
customs, The Natural Cycle. This custom was for the young elves to reach the
very heart of the Shadowsong forest to recieve the forests blessing. While
Venalis was one of the first of the young elves to reach the heart of the forest
he instantly knew that there was something wrong.

Returning to town Venalis reported his findings to the Elders. They revealed
that this was not the first time this darkness had claimed their forest. Venalis
learnt about the abandoned tower in the far northern reaches of the forest and
how darkness once spewed forth from it. It was told that some ancient evil had
made it's home there once before and was beaten back by the combined efforts of
elves and the mountain dwarves. The elders tasked Venalis with leaving
Easthollow to gain the allies that they would require to once again combat the
darkness. Venalis was given a letter to Drogur Ironshadow, an old ally who
fought with the elves last time,with strict instructions that only he was to see
it.

Venalis had only a short time to say goodbye to his mother Nexxis, promising her
that he'd be back as fast as possible. Venalis left Easthollow, heading towards
the capital of the dwarves.

#Zaradae, Elf Ranger

![Zaradae](/assets/images/characters/zaradae.png)

Born and raised an elf of Mirkwood, a young Zaradae immediately knew that the
life of a self-centred forest dweller was not for her. Her views on what was
important and meaningful in life led her to flee the territory during the
celebration of her hundredth birthday.

Unsure where to go next Zaradae wandered the lands in search of elven folk who
shared her ideals. She managed to find the elven city of Rivendell after years
of travel. She spent fifty years living with her open-minded elven kin but
slowly grew tired of the unnecessary flamboyance of their lifestyle. She
departed Rivendell on good terms and began once again wandering the lands in
search of like minded folk. During her travels she encountered a good number of
land dwellers of different races and realized that the Rivendell open-mindedness
had rubbed off on her.

Throughout her travels she constantly heard people mention a nomadic tribe of
outcasts called the Khurshid people. These people lived off the land and worked
individually and as a tribe to accomplish their goals. Zaradae finds herself at
home with the tribes people and decides that she is willing to spend her time
and skills helping these people.

Late one night, there was a commotion where a seemingly aggressive Orc stumbled
into the camp. She was a disheveled mess. A group of my tribesmen circle the orc
woman, weapons drawn, when Marius ordered her execution to extinguish and
possible threat to his people. They discovered a young half-orc child in her
arms and Marius takes him in as his own. Unhappy with the prejudice against the
Orc woman, Zaradae move away from the tribe but decided to keep an eye on the
half-orc spawn. Keeping a distance, Zaradae watches the Orc grow and mature.

The day Pring began his pilgrimage Zaradae followed the half-orc through
the woods keeping a watchful eye. After days of travelling Pring discoveres a
letter in his pack and enters a furious rage. Before he could hurt himself or
someone else Zaradae disrupt his rage with several arrows to the arm. After an
ale, or seven, to calm him down Zaradae decided to look out for him, as she felt
obliged to do after the Khurshid people has slain his mother. Pring doesn't show
much interest in Zaradae, which suited her as she don't say much and doesn’t
want him to know that she was part of the tribe that killed his mother. The less
he knew about her the better.
